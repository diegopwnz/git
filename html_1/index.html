		<h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>

		<h2 class="title">act 1</h2>
		<h2 class="title">prologue</h2>
		<p>
			Two households, both alike in dignity, <br>
			in fair Verona, where we lay our scene, <br>
			From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, <br>
			Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. <br>
			From forth the fatal loins of these two foes <br>
			A pair of stars-cross'd lovers take their life; <br>
			Whose misadventured piteous overthrows <br>
			Do with their death bury their death-mark'd love, <br>
			And the continuance of their parents' rage, <br>
			Which, but their children's end, nought could remove, <br>
			is now the two hours' traffic of our stage; <br>
			The which if you with patient ears attend, <br>
			What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.

		<p>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</p>

		<p>No, for then we should be colliers.</p>
