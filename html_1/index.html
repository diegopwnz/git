			<dt class="dl__title">TAG</dt>
			<dd class="dl__title">In information systems, a tag is a keyword of term assigned to a piece of information (
				such as an internet
				bookmark, digital image, database record, of computer file). This kind of metadata helps describe an item
				and allows it to be found again by browsing of searching. <sup><a href="">[1]</a></sup> Tags are generally
				chosen
				informally and personally b the item's creator or by its viewer, depending on the system, although they may
				also be choosen from a controlled vocabulary. <sup><a href="">[2]</a></sup></dd>

			<dt class="dl__title">ATTRIBUTE</dt>
			<dd class="dl__text">HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag to control the element's
				behaviour. HTML
				attributes are a modifier of an HTML element type. An attribute either modifies the default functionaly of
				an element type of provides functionality to certain element types unable to function corryctly withount
				them. In HTML syntax, an attribute is added to an HTML start tag.</dd>

			<dt class="dt__title">ELEMENT</dt>
			<dd>An HTML element is an individual component of a HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) document or web
				page.[vague] HTML is composed of a tree of HTML nodes, such as text nodes. Each node can have HTML,
				attributes specified. Nodes can also have content, including other nodes and text. Many HTML nodes represent
				semantics, or meaning. For example, the &lt; title &gt; node represents the title of the document. </dd>
